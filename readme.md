 Project Overview
 This project is my personal portfolio website "Earl Nathaniel Uy". It serves as a platform to showcase my skills, education, and film projects, allowing potential collaborators, employers, or clients to view my body of work and get in touch with me. The website includes sections for personal information, educational background, projects, and contact details.

 Purpose
 The main goal of the website is to provide the work of Earl as a film director to an online audience. It aims to:
- Help present a general description of my background
- Display images & descriptions for key film projects.
- Make people that learn about my education, work, and ways to contact me, get it in an easy to navigate interface.
- It can be used as a visual resume, easily shared online.

What are the key components?
The key components of this website are:
Navbar: A navigation bar where you save 4 sections like "About Me", "Education", "Projects" and "Contact."

Education Section: A collection of images and descriptions of schools attended and educational milestones.

How is the technology used and what technology is used?
The website is built using the following technologies:

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
